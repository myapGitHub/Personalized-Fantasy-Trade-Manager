# Workout-Application 


This website is a workout tool where you can make an account and input your one rep max on certain lifts. Users can sign up, make a workout plan, and view other user’s workouts. Users will also be able to take other user’s workout plans and the website will automatically use your lighting weights to calculate what weights to use for each exercise in that specific plan.
Examples of the type of information provided are a place to upload workout plans, a username search including public and private accounts, alternate user workout data, and a feature to edit your one rep max weights as you improve. 
The purpose of this application is to provide the users with viable workout plans to help them reach their fitness goals. In fitness, one of the hardest things can be figuring out how much weight to use on a set to get the optimal performance. We believe this application can enhance the experience of working out and allow for more collaboration in the fitness community.
